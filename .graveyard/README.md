Welcome to the graveyard: where I hoard my old code. 


1) Why not delete it? 
1.1) I like keeping my old code handy as a testament to how far I have come. 
1.2) I think progress is not only about writing new code, but polishing old code as well; especially in the context of broader software design.   
1.3) I sometimes look back to recall facing a implementation challenge.
1.4) I am proud of some of my old code too.

2) Why not move it elsewhere?
2.1) I like working out of one repo; "working out of" includes the action relevant to 1.1.

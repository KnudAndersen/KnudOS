### Welcome to the graveyard: where I hoard my old code. 

#### **Q1)** Why not delete it?

A1.1) I like keeping my old code handy as a testament to how far I have come. 

A1.2) I think progress is not only about writing new code, but polishing old code as well; especially in the context of broader software design.   

A1.3) I sometimes look back to recall facing a implementation challenge.

A1.4) I am proud of some of my old code too.

#### **Q2)** Why not move it elsewhere?

A2.1) I like working out of one repo; "working out of" includes the action relevant to A1.1 & A1.3.
